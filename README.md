# DelayCat

DelayCat is a Feature-Based Delay Line implementation using music information retrieval (MIR) and concatenative synthesis for novel audio effects. Based on the associated DAFx 2023 research paper: [Feature-Based Delay Line Using Real Time Concatenative Synthesis](https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/search.php?q=Feature%20Based%20Delay%20Line%20Using%20Real-Time%20Concatenative%20Synthesis&years=2023).

Recently underwent GUI overhaul (as well as adding some features). Still in progress and to be released officilly soon.
